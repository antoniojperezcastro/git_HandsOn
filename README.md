This is a simple code in python to tell if a given sequence is DNA, RNA or neither. Also it provides the option of looking for a motif in the given sequence
The usage consist in calling the program (seqClass.py) in python and giving the sequence to be analyzed after the flag -s or --seq, and optionally give the motif to be found after the 
flag -m or --motif.   
Example: in the command line, type:  python seqClass.py -s ATCTAGCTGATGCTAGCTGAC -m TAGC
